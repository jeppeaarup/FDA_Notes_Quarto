# Week 4
In this week we are going to discuss non-continuous data, and look at binary and count data. This task involves probability distributions such as binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution. 

## Hand-in assignment
@ex-fig-bars *Fig bars* is to be handed in (through absalon or as hard-copy Wednesday night). You are welcome to put in R-code in the assignment, but it is your argumentation and interpretation that are the most important. 

## Exercises

For Monday work through the following exercises:

* @ex-chocolate-and-binomial-data
* @ex-triangle-test
* @ex-uncertainty-of-the-binomial-dist

If you really think that this is easy stuff, then try to work through exercise @ex-dist-of-extreme-values

For Wednesday work through the following exercises:

* @ex-qa-poisson
* @ex-qa-poisson-binomial
* @ex-qa-chance-of-false-rejections

## Case II
The second case should be handed in as a slide-show with voice no later than Thursday evening.
